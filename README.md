# bio_analysis_project

This was a project done in conjunction with the PCC Biology department with the intention of analyzing some wildlife observational data at two different locations. 

After doing some cleaning and reformatting of the data to make it more usable I began to graph out some key relationships between types of animals seen at different times of
day, temperatures, barometric pressures, and general weather patterns. In addition to this was some data about activities seen, which got broken out into more usable Boolean
columns and graphed as well. All of these images were saved as well as the cleaned and reformatted csv file for possible future use.

One thing that was noticed about the datasets was that all the observations came within a window of roughly two months (May and June) which means it's difficult to draw any
insights about the animals throughout an entire year. The most obvious next step for this analysis would be continuing observations all year round and comparing results month 
to month.

There is also some distinction between males/females and adults/babies for a few of the species, which isn't a distinction I bothered to explore. I suspect there are some 
interesting conclusions to draw with that information but I didn't feel knowledgeable enough to draw out those conclusions.
